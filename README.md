Missing-Days-Visualization
==========================

This D3 visualization focuses on exposing patterns in missing data. It exposes the time-stamped data along with the number of missing days in a given month. 

A live version is available [here](http://quantifiedself.com/visproject/meditation.html). 

Example Data
------------

The example data included here was generated by a long-term meditation tracking practice. Meditation sessions were tracked using the [Equanimity App](http://www.meditate.mx/iphone). Equanimity offers a csv export function in the app. The data in this example was donated by [Gary Wolf](http://www.twitter.com/aether).

Attributions

This visualization was developed with help from Brandon Liu [web](http://bdon.org)/[github](http://www.github.com/bdon).
